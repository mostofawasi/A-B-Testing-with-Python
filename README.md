# AB Testing with Python 🧪📊

Welcome to the **AB Testing with Python** project! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that walks through the complete process of A/B testing using statistical techniques to make data-driven business decisions.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `AB_Testing with Python.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the A/B Testing workflow using Python.
- `ab_testing_data.xlsx`: Sample dataset used for A/B testing analysis.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project.

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project is to perform A/B testing using real-world-style data. It compares the effectiveness of two versions of a product or service using hypothesis testing and draws conclusions based on statistical evidence.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization
- **Scipy.stats** – for statistical hypothesis testing

## 📊 Key Concepts Covered

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical Hypothesis Testing
- p-value interpretation
- A/B Test Implementation
- Business recommendations based on statistical outcomes

## 📈 Use Case

A/B Testing is widely used in marketing, product design, and web optimization. This project mimics how companies decide whether to roll out new features or stick with current offerings by comparing performance metrics (e.g., conversion rates, user engagement).

## 💡 What You'll Learn

- How to set up a valid A/B test
- Framing null and alternative hypotheses
- Choosing and applying the correct statistical tests
- Drawing insights and making business decisions based on test results
